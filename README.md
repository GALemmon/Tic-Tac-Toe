#### Overview

Do you enjoy the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe?  Even if you don't, here is a slightly 'Marvel-ous' version to try.  This game automates the 'arduous' processes of score keeping and keeping track of who's turn it is.  Give it a try!

#### How To Use

To play, simply click on one of the game squares after choosing to be Tony or Steve.  The game will handle everything else. A reminder of whose turn it is will appear above the game board.  To reset the win counters, refresh the page.

- Click a square for player 1. This will deploy a hero and make your square.
- Click a square for player 2. This will deploy a hero and make your square.
- Play though a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- If either player wins, the game will announce the win, add a win to the win counter, and reset.
- In the event of a draw, the game will announce the draw and reset.
- The win counters will persist until the page is reloaded.
